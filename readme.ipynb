    "Sustainable AI – Prompt Optimizer & Energy Estimator\n",
    "This project provides an interactive tool to optimize AI prompts for better efficiency while estimating the associated energy consumption, CO₂ emissions, and potential savings. Users can input their AI prompts, receive improved suggestions, and view comparative energy usage through intuitive visualizations like pie charts and KPI indicators. The system uses NLP techniques to shorten and refine prompts without losing meaning, aiming to reduce computational costs. It also offers insights into sustainability impact for AI workloads, helping developers, researchers, and organizations make environmentally conscious choices when using large language models and other AI systems.\n",

    "## Project Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This project presents an **interactive energy optimization tool** built using **Streamlit**. It leverages **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** to interpret user input and uses trained machine learning models to predict CO₂ emissions and spot anomalies in energy usage. The goal is to help users understand their energy consumption better and recommend optimizations based on predictions and insights.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Features\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Natural Language Interface**: Explain your energy usage in natural language and get insights.\n",
    "- **CO₂ Emission Prediction**: Estimate emissions using a trained machine learning model (`co2_predictor.joblib`).\n",
    "- **Anomaly Detection**: Identify unusual energy consumption behaviors via an Isolation Forest model (`iso_forest.pkl`).\n",
    "- **Visualization & Insights**: Provide interactive charts and usage breakdowns (via reports and visualizations).\n",
    "- **User-Friendly Interface**: Seamless interactivity powered by Streamlit.\n",
